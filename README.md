#  Blind Auction – Python Project

A simple console-based **Blind Auction** game built with Python.  
Multiple users can place their bids, but no one can see others' bids until the auction ends. The highest bidder wins!

## 🚀 Features

- Allows multiple participants to place secret bids
- Clears the console between each bid for privacy
- Determines the highest bidder at the end

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
3. Run the script in your terminal:

bash
python main.py


🧠 What I Learned

Working with functions and dictionaries

Using loops and conditionals effectively

Console clearing techniques (platform-dependent)

Handling user input securely


📌 Requirements

No external libraries needed — just Python's built-in functionality.
